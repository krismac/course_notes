## JavaScript Group Project Guidelines

## Aims

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome them
- To have the opportunity to use Agile working methods
- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module
- To investigate some JavaScript libraries you haven't used before (learning how to read docs is an invaluable skill)
- To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO front-end frameworks or jQuery are allowed. If you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

## Expectations

- All members of the group contributing to the planning, development and presentation of the project
- Members supporting each other to make sure everyone can get the most they can from the week
- TDD - unit testing of models where appropriate
- Some application of Agile concepts e.g. a morning standup, sprints, a kanban board (Trello)
- Regular Git commits and use of branches with frequent merges. We are looking to see at least 100 commits.

## Initial Planning

### Learning Goals of Team Members

At the start of the project have a discussion to establish what everyone wants to get out of it. Some people may be more focused on practicing what they’ve already learned, some may be keen to try out something new, some people may have a preference of what area they want to focus on. Find a way of enabling team members to reach their learning goals while ensuring all parts of the application get built.

### MVP

Plan thoroughly so you’re all clear about the aim for the end result. Set out an MVP that doesn't contain any features that are not crucial to the functioning of the application. Split the project into small features to tackle one at a time.

### Setup

It can work well to set up the basic app, directories etc together first so you all understand the core structure before you split up to work on different features.
Use git branches and commit and merge regularly.

## Helpful Hints to Avoid Common Gotchas

### APIs

- Investigate the APIs you are planning to use and make sure you can get the data back you need into you application before writing code dependent on that API.
- Check for daily/hourly usage limits.
- When making a request to an API, if you get a CORS error in the console, speak to an instructor and we give you notes on making server-side requests, which will solve the problem.
- Don't push your API keys up to GitHub.

### Unknowns

- Explore your unknowns early.
- If you are working with a library you haven't used before, or trying to do something you don't know how to do, set time aside early in the week to investigate it.
- Put a time limit on how long you will spend investigating it, and have a plan B ready if you are unable to figure it out.
- Consider investigating features in a separate test project to check you can implement your plan, before integrating it into your main project.
