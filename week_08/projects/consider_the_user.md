# Consider the User Experience

## User Needs and User Journey: What is it that we are building?

Before you begin coding, it's important to spend some time considering the user of your product. Doing this at the beginning, can help guide which features you decide to implement and how you implement them.

Ask yourself the following questions:

- What user needs is your product going to answer? Can you document them?
- Why would your users want to use your product over something similar that they've seen elsewhere?
- How could you make sure that your web app uses interface solutions that users are familiar with so that it is intuitive to use?
- What is the user journey â€” how will users interact with your product, and how many steps will be necessary to complete their goals?

Make sure to prepare a simple wireframe of the web app, sketching out all major steps of the user journey that you've identified. Think of potential problems and ways of addressing these in a way that makes the user experience intuitive.

- Use this [user needs template](https://goo.gl/zHbfud) to document your users' needs
- Download and print out the [template for the user journey](https://goo.gl/zXkgtZ). Use it to map the steps of the journey. Remember about user actions and system responses. What is required for every particular screen?
- [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/) is an tool that allows you to build interactive prototypes.

## Focus Group: Asking users' opinion

Show it to your colleagues and ask them their opinion. Can they think of anything that could be improved? If so, sketch the change and test with the same person. See if they think the change is an improvement.

Once you have been through this process, you can start to implement the design knowing that the features and UI are useable and appropriate.

## Accessibility and Best Practice

Are you sure that:

- Your HTML is semantically correct and all tags are used appropriately?
- Your CSS refers to classes and id's where it should?
- The interface is robust and fast?
- You are not using any unusual interface features that could make people think too hard?
- Your web app would be easy to use even for someone who hasn't experienced it earlier?

### Retrospective: what did we learn and what can be improvement?

- Show your web app to a couple of colleagues. Can they use it? Is there anything that could be quickly changed to make it more user-friendly?
- Talk about your experience of planning for the best outcome in your presentation. How did the light touch UX work change the final product? What design decisions did you take after testing it with a friend?
