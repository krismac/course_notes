# Full-stack Lab: Bucket List App

**Lab Duration: All day**

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a full-stack app
- Practice building a server with a MongoDB for persistence
- Understand the relationship between a client, server and database

## Brief

Build a bucket list browser web-app, that allows a user to create a list of things they want to do in their lifetime. The bucket list items should be stored in a MongoDB via an JSON API in Express.

### MVP

- Users should be able to view all previously saved bucket list items on the page
- Users should be able to submit an item to save it to the database and see it added to the page

### Extensions

- Users should be able to delete bucket list items
- Users should be able to mark list items as "completed" and save the new status
- Style the front-end application with CSS

## Considerations

Test your code often. Try not to write very much code before you run it again. We value working software, even if it is not feature-complete and want to isolate problems so we can fix them more quickly. You can use Insomnia REST Client to test the Express API.

## Planning

Make a plan for the order in which you are going to develop your application. Will you build the back-end API and test it with Insomnia before building the front-end? Or will you follow one route at a time from front to back (or back to front), checking the data being passed as you go?

Other planning might include:
  - making a list of your dependencies, at what points you'll need them and any steps required for their configuration
  - draw diagrams, eg. detailing application architecture and/or data flow
