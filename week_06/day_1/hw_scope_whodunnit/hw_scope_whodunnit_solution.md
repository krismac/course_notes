# Scope Homework Solution: Who Dunnit

#### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
};

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The murderer is Miss Scarlet.`  
Reason: `declareMurderer` is called, which returns a string that refers to the `murderer` property on the `scenario` object.

#### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `TypeError`  
Reason: The variable `murderer` is declared with the `const` keyword, so it cannot be resigned. When the `changeMurderer` function is called, it attempts to reassign the `murderer` variable, producing the type error `Assignment to constant variable`.

#### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
};

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);
```

Output: `First Verdict:  The murderer is Mrs. Peacock.` `Second Verdict:  The murderer is Professor Plum.`  
Reason: The `declareMurderer` function is called, which creates a new local variable, `murderer` with the value of 'Mrs. Peacock' and returns a string that refers to local variable. This does not effect the initial `murderer` variable, so when the second verdict accesses the outer variable, it is still 'Professor Plum'.


#### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
};

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
```

Output: `The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard.`
`Suspect three is Mrs. Peacock.`
Reason: The initial suspect variables are declared. `suspectThree` has the value 'Mrs. Peacock'. When the `declareAllSuspects` function is called, it creates a new local variable `suspectThree` with the value 'Colonel Mustard' and does not effect the initial variable of the same name. The string returned by `declareAllSuspects` refers to the two initial variables `suspectOne` and `suspectTwo` and the local variable `suspectThree`. The second log refers to the unchanged initial variable, `suspectThree` with the value 'Mrs. Peacock'.

#### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
};

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
};

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The weapon is the Revolver.`
Reason: `changeWeapon` is called, changing the `scenario`'s `weapon` property to 'Revolver'. `delclareWeapon` is then called, returning a string that refers to the `scenario`'s `weapon` property.

Note: The `scenario` variable is declared using the `const` keyword so it cannot be reassigned. However an object is mutable, so its properties can be modified without it being a reassignment.

#### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The murderer is Mrs. White.`
Reason: `changeMurder` is called, which first reassigns `murderer` to have the value 'Mr. Green', then calls a second function, `plotTwist`, which reassigns `murderer` to have the value 'Mrs. White'. `declareMurderer` is then called returning a string that refers to `murderer`.

#### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The murderer is Mr. Green.`
Reason: `changeMurderer` is called, which first reassigns `murderer` to have the value 'Mr. Green'. It then calls `plotTwist` that creates a new local variable `murderer` with the value 'Colonel Mustard', which does not effect the initial `murderer` variable. `unexpectedOutcome` is then called which reassigns the local variable in the `plotTwist` function to be 'Miss Scarlet', but again, does not effect the initial `murderer` variable. When `declareMurderer` is called, it returns a string that refers to the initial `murderer` variable, which has only been reassigned once.

#### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The weapon is Candle Stick.`
Reason: `changeScenario` is called which update's `scenario`'s `murderer` property to 'Mrs. Peacock' and its `room` property to 'Dining Room'. Next `plotTwist` is called and checks if the scenario's room property is equal to 'Dining Room', which it is, so updates the `scenario`'s '`murderer` property to be 'Colonel Mustard'. Then `unexpectedOutcome` is called, which checks if the `scenario`'s `murderer` property is equal to 'Colonel Mustard', which it is, so it updates the `scenario`'s `weapon` property to be 'Candle Stick'. Then `declareWeapon` is called, which returns a string referring to the updated `scenario`'s `weapon` property.

#### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Output: `The murderer is Professor Plum.`
Reason: A variable `murderer` is declared with the value of 'Professor Plum'. The an `if` statement checks if `murderer` is equal to 'Professor Plum', which it is, so it creates a new local `murderer` variable with the value of 'Mrs. Peacock'. Because variables declared with the `let` and `const` keywords are block scoped, is does not effect the initial `murder` variable. When `declareMurderer` is called, it returns a string that refers to the initial `murder` variable.
