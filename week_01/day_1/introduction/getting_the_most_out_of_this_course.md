# Getting The Most Out Of This Course

## Welcome!

Here are a few tips for you as you embark on your CodeClan journey:
 
- We are going to ask you to work things out for yourself. It means thinking for yourself at times. This can be hard and messy and you might not always get the answers. But the simple act of trying to work it out is way more valuable than being told the answer. 

- Most learning comes from doing. So although we will show you things and teach concepts during the lessons, 90% of your learning will come from working on labs and homework individually or in pairs or groups.

- This course is hard and will require [deep work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). That is, focusing for periods of time on practicing programming. 

- Simply by being here you are shifting your normal way of learning to an immersive one. This environment is perfect for deep work and learning. For example, to finish the final Harry Potter book, JK Rowling booked herself into the Balmoral hotel to be in a different environment. This switch can help your brain shift into a different mode.


## Your Learning

- Code alongs: We do quite a lot of codealongs. If we’re going too fast, just say. It's not a problem! Please ask questions as we go. Talking through your thought process benefits everyone. Be comfortable with rubber ducking in front of your classmates. And be compassionate to anyone who is rubber ducking. Be patient and helpful. 

- Homework: We won’t be marking homework or giving grades but we will look at them all and if there is something that you need to go over or solidify you can add it to the comments and we can cover it in the homework review. Please note down questions as you do your homework so we can get them addressed in the daily homework review.

- Feedback: Your responsibility as a receiver of feedback is to adopt a growth mindset and take feedback as constructive.

- We will ask you sometimes to come up and talk through your code with the class. This are a few reasons for this:

  - It will give you practice and build your confidence in talking about code
  - It will help you become more confident speaking in public which can enhance many areas of your professional career.
  - Please be compassionate and supportive of your fellow students when they are showing their code. It’s not an easy thing to do!

- Daily homework reviews are varied but the aim of it is to address any questions or problems that you have had with it. This might involve:

  - Asking people to show their code to the class and doing a group debug
  - Going over questions from last night’s homework
  - Group discussion
  - A quiz
  - An ad-hoc code along together
  - Mondays will be one-to-one homework reviews

## Asking for Help

If you're asking an instructor for help with your code - or anyone else for that matter - it will benefit you both if you think about the following steps:

  - Explain the problem or bug as clearly as possible. What did you expect to see? What are you seeing instead? 
  - What error message are you seeing (if any)?
  - What was the last thing you changed or added in your code before things stopped working?

Once you've prepared this information, make sure you push your code to Github so that your instructor can see it, if they need to. This is especially important if you're asking for help over Slack.

You might even find that the act of following this process, and preparing this information, gives you the answer you need! (Rubber-ducking again!)

## Dedication & Mindset

 - [The power of believing that you can improve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E)
- [Growth vs Fixed Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU)

  - Resourcefulness: Adopt the belief that all problems in code are discoverable. It’s all made by humans after all.

  - Grit: Ability to persevere and work through challenges without beating yourself up. Be kind to yourself and your fellow students.

  - Practice: Becoming good at anything requires practice. We all know this. Find a way that works for you. I use pomodoro technique.

  
 - If you don’t know how to solve a problem or don’t know what you’re doing, just start. The simple of act of starting will shift your brain into problem solving mode.
