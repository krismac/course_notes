# Homework

## Learning objectives
- Practise making a request in a React app and passing the data from that request down the chain of components
- Practise using stateless components

## Task

Make a simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs. You can get the data for this here:

https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json

You are required to use a stateless component as part of your app. 

The MVP is to request the data, then display the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist. If you don't like music (why?!) you can go to the link below and choose a different iTunes chart for books/movies etc.

## Extensions
Add more information - you could include images or the preview song audio clips. Style this nicely with CSS.

AND/OR

Add a dropdown to choose a genre of music to display - more URLS can be found at this page, just change the 'xml' part to 'json': https://rss.itunes.apple.com/us/?urlDesc=%2Fgenerator
