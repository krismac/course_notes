### Gym

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
- The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

#### Possible Extensions

- Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
