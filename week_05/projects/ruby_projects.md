# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

Do not attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before. This project

Make lots of little (and sensible) git commits.

## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

Your code will be reviewed with an instructor through the week.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Friday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, then 5 minutes for questions and answers from your cohort mates and instructors.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

## Attendance

The cohort will meet for stand-up at the usual time every morning. If you can't come in to CodeClan, let the instructors know.

## PDA Reminder

Remember to gather evidence for your PDA this week. This should only take 5 minutes:

* Go to your [PDA Checklist](https://github.com/codeclan/pda/tree/master/Student%20Checklist)
* Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo
