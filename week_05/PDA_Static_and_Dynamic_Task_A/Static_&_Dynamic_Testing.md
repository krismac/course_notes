## PDA Software Development
#### Implementation and Testing Unit Level 8

##### Testing tasks

 - If you haven't already, create a github repo for PDA evidence. Once you have completed both of the tasks, save the files with corrected code to your PDA github repo.

#### Task 1: Static Testing

  Carry out static testing on testing_task_1.md.  

  Read through the code. Comment any errors you can see but do not correct them in this file.


#### Task 2: Dynamic Testing

  Carry out dynamic testing on testing_task_2.rb.

  Read through the code. Create a spec file and write a test for each function. Screenshot the tests and the tests failing. Correct the errors you spotted in task A. Screenshot the tests and the tests passing, you can use this evidence for P18 of your project unit.
