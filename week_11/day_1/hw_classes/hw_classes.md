# Homework - Single Classes

Create 3 single classes with methods to perform some functionality.

## MVP

### Calculator

- Create a Calculator class. This should have functions for Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide, each taking in two `int`s, performing the appropriate calculations, and returning the result.

### Water Bottle

- Create a water bottle class with a volume property.
- The volume should start at 100.
- Add a drink function that takes 10 from the volume each time it is called.
- Create an empty function that brings the volume down to 0.
- Create a fill function that fills the volume back to 100.

## Extension

### Printer

- Create a Printer class that has a property for number of sheets of paper left.
- Add a method to print that takes in a number of pages to be printed and number of copies to print.
- The print method will only run if the printer has enough paper. If it runs it will reduce the value of the paper left by number of copies \* number of pages.
- Create a method to refill the printer paper.
- Add a toner volume property to the class.
- Modify the printer so that it reduces the toner by 1 for each page printed.
