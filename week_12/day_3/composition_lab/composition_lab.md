# CodeClan Cars

**Duration 2.5 hours**

Model a car dealership (e.g. Arnold CodeClan), making sure to use the concepts that we've covered in Java so far as appropriate.

You should be working in a TDD fashion and creating tests for your classes. Make sure you plan effectively in preparation for the extensions if you have enough time to attempt them.

## MVP
* Create classes for different components (e.g. engine, tyres) that can be used to compose a vehicle
* Create different vehicle types (e.g. Car, Electric Car, Hybrid Car, etc)
* Assign them various properties (e.g. price, colour, engine etc.)
* Create classes for other components that a dealership might have (e.g. dealer, till, customer)
* Create a Dealership class which will have stock of different types of cars. 

## Extension
* Allow a customer to buy a vehicle or book a rental vehicle
* Allow dealership to buy vehicles
* Allow damage to be added to a vehicle. This should be a cost and be removed from vehicles price.
* Allow dealership to repair vehicles. This should take the cost from the dealer and add back to value of vehicle.
