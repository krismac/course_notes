## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists
* Create and Save Albums
* List All Artists/Albums

* List all the albums they have by an artist
* Show the artist any album belongs to

Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

## Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* Edit Artists/Albums
* Delete Artists/Albums
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID

Remember to regularly git commit!
