# Introduction to Diagrams

## Learning objectives
1. Know what diagrams are used for in programming.
2. Understand how diagrams can help us 
3. Be able to draw a class diagram

## Intro 
So far we've been giving you specifications of things we'd like you to build. However often you'll be faced with a problem and have to figure out a possible solution to it yourself. It can be tempting to just dive in and start coding but this can waste time if you go down the wrong track without thinking things through.

This brings us to... planning! It's always good to plan out your work before you try to code it. This helps you to write well-organised, easy to understand code. We will have a longer lesson on planning near to your first projects, so for now we'll focus on one aspect of it - drawing diagrams.

Drawing a diagram lets us visualise the structure of our code. Doing this before we write any code can help us spot any potential problem areas, or let us think of several possible solutions and choose which one we think is best. 

There are various pieces of software you can use to create diagrams, but for now we'll just use a pen/pencil and paper.

## Class Diagrams

Class diagrams can help us think about what components will make up our program. We can plan out what properties and methods they might need, how many different classes might be necessary, and what relationships they should have with each other. 

You may have heard of UML - Unified Modelling Language. This is a language intended to provide a standardised way of modelling software systems. They also have a standardised set of diagrams that can be used for modelling code in any language. 

We're going to be using diagrams that are similar to UML ones, but we aren't too concerned about strictly following their formal rules. The first type of diagram we'll look at are class diagrams.

- Show a class diagram for one class and explain the different parts - name, attributes, methods. (e.g. Person)
- Show a class diagram for several classes with lines to show the connections. (e.g Author, WritingTool)
